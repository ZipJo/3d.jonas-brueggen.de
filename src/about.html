<section class="about">
	<article>
		<p>I've been working for roughly six years as a middleware developer in Germany. For the past two years I've been travelling and doing occasional volunteer work, but web design has always been my main professional interest so I also started freelancing in this area.</p>

		<p>I have eight years of experience with web development. My professional background lies mostly in process automation with big-data and focuses on performance and stability, as well as encryption and security.<br />
		Layouting and UX-design have always been really interesting to me.</p>

		<p>I started working and studying at the same time as part of a "Dual-Program" in 2011.</p>

		<p>I have a professional certification as a systems-integrator (network-design) and a degree in computer sciences, with IT consulting and project management as a main focus.</p>

		<p>If you're interested in working with me, feel free to <a class="fancy_link" onclick="jb_scripts.triggerContactTileAnimation();" ontouchend="jb_scripts.touchRemover(this);">contact me</a>.</p>
