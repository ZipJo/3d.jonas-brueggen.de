<section class="about">
	<article>
		<p>I've been working roughly six years as a middleware developer in Germany. I've been travelling for the past two years, doing occasional volunteer work, but since webdesign has always been my main professional interest, I started freelancing in this area.</p>

		<p>I have about eight years of experience with webdevelopment and I have gotten more serious around 2017. My professional background lies mostly in process automation with big-data and focuses on performance and stability, as well as encryption and security.<br />
		Personally, layouting and UX-design have always been really interesting to me.</p>

		<p>I started working and studying at the same time as part of a "Dual-Program" in 2011.</p>

		<p>I have a professional certification as a systems-integrator, meaning network-design and a degree in computer sciences with IT consulting and project management as a main focus.</p>

		<p>If you're interested in working with me, <a class="fancy_link" onclick="jb_scripts.triggerContactTileAnimation();">just contact me</a>.</p>
